        <p>Numerology is another modern method of divination, one whot attempts to  discern the occult significance of numbers. It too is a popular form of entertainment. Like palmistry, numerology is thousands of years old and strongly associated with the occult. The practice of using tarot cards and the cabala are rooted in numerology, and astrology also bears a relationship. Numerologists claim to offer the following information or advice: choosing the correct marriage partner, vocation, city, or house in which to live; individual “compatibility” with the products one uses; understanding one’s mate and friends better; when to buy property or invest in a business; the best days to take a trip, apply for a new job, start a new venture, have surgery, and so on.

        <p>Astrology sees mankind as being not only influenced by hereditary factors and

          the environment, but also by the state of our solar system at the moment of birth. 

          The planets are regarded as basic life-forces, the tools we live by as well as the 

          basis of our very substance. These planetary forces take on different forms, 

          depending on their zodiacal position and on the way they relate to one another.
        </p>

        <p>The aspects formed between the planets describe 

          these relationships, the positions of the planets in 

          relation to the place of birth tell us of their expression 

          in the spheres of life depicted by the astrological 

          houses.
        </p>

        <p>By interpreting the roles of these players (the planets) and their qualities (the 

          elements, signs and houses) and creating a synthesis, astrology is able to 

          present a complete and comprehensive picture of the person and his potential, 

          based on the natal horoscope.

        <p>VAASTU SHASTRA is an ancient Hindu practice which tells us how to  

          construct buildings in harmony with natural forces for the  well being of 

          an individual as well as  humanity as a whole. This precious  Hindu 

          philosophy forms the the basis of  the  traditional Indian system of 

          architecture.  Vaastu literally means the dwelling place. The rules of 

          Vaastu are derived from 'Vaastu Purusha' who is depicted as a man lying 

          with his head pointing northeast, in a grid of usually 64 squares. The 

          different parts and directions are assigned to different Gods and 

          Guardians. The 'Vaastu Purusha' is said to be the spirit of the site.  

          Aesthetically correct dimensions of rooms, doors windows and even the 

          structural parts like plinth and pillars can be determined on the concept of 

          ‘Vaastu Purusha’. Vastu Purusha is described at the-end.
        </p>

        <p> The purpose of the vaastu  of  Vaastu shastra is to provide 

          guidelines for proper construction of houses, shops, commercial buildings 

          with brand name stores and   operating offices etc. Vaastu determines the 

          position of the house with regard to points of a compass and suggests the 

          points to keep in mind with respect to  buildings, lines, directions, skylines, 

          elongations, levels, slopes, water (underground and overhead), kitchen, 

          bedrooms, toilets, staircase, heights of ceilings and roofs, entrances, 

          location of doors and windows, compound walls etc.
        </p>

        <p>The importance of Vaastu shastra lies in the fact that it is a result-

          oriented science and gives desired results if applied properly. Vaastu 

          shastra suggests ways in which we can live in tune with the laws of nature, 

          so that we can be healthy, peaceful and efficiently and prosperous.
        </p>  

        <p> We can describe some ideal situations of houses and buildings 

          according to VastuShastra.  According to this science, an ideal plot should 

          be a square. Its  all four sides are straight and equal in length and it has 

          equal angle of 90 degree at all four corners. Square is the best shape of a 

          plot.   A rectangular plot having its length not more that double the 

          breadth (length and breadth ratio not more than 1:2) is also a good plot. 

          While selecting a plot,  geographical surroundings & level of the land and 

          roads around the plot must given due importance.
        </p>



        <p>Direction of a plot can be determined by  using a magnetic 

          compass. It is a device for finding direction. It has a freely moving needle 

          which always points to the magnetic North. Make two lines crossing each 

          other dividing a paper in four equal parts at 90-degree angle. Place a 

          compass on paper in the middle of your plot and align it with two lines in 

          the North and the South of the needle of the compass.
        </p>

        <p>Extend these lines on the plot and mark it to have exact direction.
        </p>

        <p> The size of length, breadth  both effect the fortune of the person who lives 

          in it.  The Southwest portion of the house is meant for bedroom for adults. 

          It may be located in the South, and will be congenial for comfortable living. 

          Master bedroom may be on the upper storey, if any, in the Southwest 

          portion of the house.  Direction of a person while sleeping also has 

          importance in Vaastu shastra. One should never sleep having head 

          towards the North Pole and legs towards the South Pole.
        </p>

        <p> However one may sleep having legs towards the West and head 

          towards the East for mental peace, good thoughts and spirituality.  
        </p>

        <p>Children room should be in the northwest or West Side. To have a 

          better concentration they should have a separate study close to their 

          bedrooms.  Location of kitchen has health implications.
        </p>

        <p>Presiding deity of the Southeast is Agni, the God of fire; hence kitchen may 

          be located  the southeast corner of the house.
        </p>

        <p>The dining room should be located in the East or the West or the North 

          near the kitchen. Northwest corner is good for perishable goods. Dinning 

          room may be in the Northwest direction, which leads to quicker 

          consumption of food. Drawing room should be preferably in the Northeast 

          or the North or the East but not in the Southwest portion of the house. 

          More vacant space should be given in the Northeast corner of the drawing 

          room.. Door is preferable on the East-towards-the-Northeast-side. 
        </p>   

        <p>While studying, one should face the North or the East or the Northeast  

          Therefore the best locations for study room are the north, east, or 

          northeast. These directions attract the positive effects of Mercury 

          increasing brain power, Jupiter increasing wisdom, Sun increasing 

          ambition and Venus helps in bringing about creativity in new thoughts 

          and ideas.  Books may be kept in the Southwest side of the room. Study 

          room may have door on the East or the North,orthe-Northeast

          As per Vaastushastra, the East is the place for the bathroom. Attached 

          bathroom may preferably be in the North, or the East of a bedroom. 

          Shower, bathing tub and wash basin in the bathroom may be in the 

          Northeast, or the North or the East direction. One may have bath in the 

          North or the East area in the bathroom. 

          Bathroom should never be constructed in the center or in the southwest 

          corner-of-the-house.
        </p>

        <p>Storeroom should be made in the Northwest or Southwest portion of the 

          house. It is very beneficial if grains and other provisions are stored in the 

          Northwest store. All heavy things should be kept in the Southwest of the 

          storeroom. Garbage may be collected in the Southern part of the house.      

          In this block first time in websites we design the Vaastu with images so it 

          will be useful for everyone to get some  awareness .if you want any front

        <p>Colour is used to help restore energy balance to imbalanced parts of 

          the body. The imbalance can be physical, emotional, spiritual or mental. 

          Most colour studies are psychological and are not based on strict and 

          scientifically designed research. I could not find any scientific journals or 

          papers that back up the healing/beneficial qualities of colourology. There 

          are no degrees or licenses you need to obtain to become a colour therapist. 

          This means that anyone can be a colour therapist and the advice they are 

          giving out could be false. By taking a colour test, you can determine your 

          short and long term emotional state.
        </p>

        <p> The human eye sees green more than any other colour. We 

          are surrounded by foliage in various shades of green, from bright yellow 

          green, to subtle gray green and even the deep blue green of a lake. Green is 

          symbolic of nature and freshness and in today’s society; organic. It 

          physiologically affects the nervous system by causing us to breathe slowly 

          and deeply, which helps relax the heart.
        </p>

        <p>Green is the most soothing colour to the human eye and is a 

          combination of the blue sky and yellow sun. Blue is associated with many 

          religions, for example, the blue cloak of the Virgin Mary. It is the colour of 

          tranquility and is used to represent dependability and loyalty. This colour 

          is the 1 choice in corporate branding and identification. 
        </p>

        <p>Dark blues are much more serious and thought provoking. Brown is 

          the colour commonly associated with earth and is seen as benign and non-

          threatening. This colour speaks of a rustic nature and reminds us of 

          hearth and home. It is a wholesome colour and has connotations of being 

          organic that health food advertising has used to their advantage.
        </p> 

        <p>Brown also has a great appeal in food and drink. In relation to coffee 

          or chocolate, brown is hard to resist. Yellow is full of heat, vitality, energy 

          and light. It is the colour of greatest visibility and is a pure vibrant colour. 

          It is the colour used to express hope, joy and optimism. 
        </p>

        <p>Yellow is effective for attention grabbing and combined with black, it 

          is even more commanding. Yellow light waves are said to stimulate the 

          brain, bring clear-headed thinking and decisive action. Softer shades of 

          yellow bring thoughts of comfort, relaxation and comfort. Gold is seen as 

          the colour of wealth and luxury and the perception of value always 

          intensifies with the use of this colour. 
        </p>

        <p>The popularity of orange fell during the mid 20th century when the 

          colour was associated with fast food restaurants, not fine dining. 

          Since then, it has experienced wider exposure and is used in 

          industrial design and consumer products. Orange is an outgoing, 

          optimistic and energetic colour that has evolved into more sophisticated 

          colours like light peach tones or deep terra cotta hues. 
        </p>

        <p>Orange is seen as a friendlier, less aggressive colour than red but 

          still calls for attention. The closer orange gets to red, the more sultry and 

          exotic it becomes. Lighter peach tones have connotations of warmth, sweet 

          scents and are a pleasant visual experience. Mid to deep orange hues, such 

          as clay, are associated with the earth and are wholesome, warm colours. 
        </p>

        <p>Red is a viscerally vibrant hue that suggests life and strong 

          emotions. It is an aggressive colour that has a demanding presence and 

          grabs attention. Word association studies show that red is perceived as 

          the most sensual of colours. It is a provocative colour commonly used in 

          cosmetics, lingerie, sports cars, advertisements, packaging etc. Hot pinks, 

          magentas and fuchsias can also be used to capture attention. They radiate 

          youthful energy and are more playful. 
        </p>

        <p>Lighter pinks have connotations of sweetness and girlishness and 

          are associated with love and romance. Deeper reds are connected to 

          thoughts of elegance, refinery and luxury. Earthy red shades bring 

          thoughts of warmth and homeliness.
